## ENTRY MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE  
In this app, on the index page you will find a form, where one needs to enter the details about his details and the person he wants to meet. The respective host will get an email and text message as per the details entered by the visitor.(*There is a problem with the SMS API, sometimes the message might not be delivered, as it is a free API*).  
The mail which the host gets will also include a form, where he has to fill the checkout time of visitor, which triggers a function and thus sends a SMS and email about the visitor's visit.  
In the code, the Email id and password from where the mails are sent needs to be changed. Currently there is no account detail put there. Those places are left with "*************".  
**Note**: The entire program needs to be run on a single system as it is based on localhost.
